# Hi, I‚Äôm Vitalij

**Cloud & DevOps Engineer** ‚Äî AWS ‚Ä¢ Infrastructure as Code ‚Ä¢ Automation ‚Ä¢ Security ‚Ä¢ Observability

> I help tech teams **set up AWS infrastructures in weeks instead of months**:
> automated (IaC), observable (dashboards/tracing), and **cost-conscious** ‚Äî without compromising security.

---

## About me
I build **secure, scalable, and maintainable** cloud platforms on AWS ‚Äî from architecture to automated operations.  
My focus: transparency through observability, reproducible deployments via IaC, and clear security guardrails.

**Typical focus areas**
- CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline)
- Infrastructure as Code (AWS CDK v2, Terraform)
- Security & compliance (GuardDuty, Security Hub, HashiCorp Vault)
- Observability & monitoring (CloudWatch, X-Ray, Grafana)

---

## What I solve for you
- **Landing Zone & IaC**: multi-account/guardrails, pipelines, repeatable stages ‚Äî **everything as code**  
- **Observability in 5 days**: CloudWatch/X-Ray/Grafana ‚Äî dashboards, alerts, runbooks  
- **Cost & Security Quick Audit**: 30‚Äì60 point check (budgets, IAM, GuardDuty, Security Hub, CloudTrail)

---

## Collaboration ‚Äî in 3 steps
1) **Quick call (30 min)** ‚Äî goals, current state, quick wins  
2) **Plan & proposal** ‚Äî scope, timeline, risks  
3) **Implementation** ‚Äî IaC, pipelines, dashboards, handover & docs  

**Availability:** from January ‚Ä¢ **Time zone:** Europe/Berlin ‚Ä¢ **NDA:** anytime ‚Ä¢ **Remote-only**

> A selection of my public repositories ‚Äî examples of architecture, IaC, and automation.

| Project | Description | Technologies & Highlights |
|---|---|---|
| **[aws-data-processing-infra](https://github.com/vibtellect/aws-data-processing-infra)** | Building a fully automated data processing infrastructure on AWS. The pipeline processes incoming data events serverlessly, performs transformations, and stores results in S3 or a database. The project shows how to build **scalable data pipelines** with IaC and monitoring. <br><br>üéØ **Learning:** End-to-end automation of data workflows with Terraform, Lambda & EventBridge, including CI/CD and security concepts. | Terraform, AWS Lambda, EventBridge, S3, CloudWatch, CI/CD |
| **[ecs-eks-service-discovery](https://github.com/vibtellect/ecs-eks-service-discovery)** | Implements **dynamic service discovery** between ECS and EKS services to connect containerized applications without manual configuration. Ideal for hybrid environments. <br><br>üéØ **Learning:** Understanding DNS-based discovery, load balancing, and networking patterns in AWS containers. | TypeScript, AWS ECS, EKS, Cloud Map, Service Mesh, Networking |
| **[high_availability_architecture](https://github.com/vibtellect/high_availability_architecture)** | Demonstrates a highly available architecture across multiple availability zones. Includes health checks, automatic failover mechanisms, and resilient components. <br><br>üéØ **Learning:** Planning and validating multi-AZ strategies, resilience testing, and automated recovery design in the cloud. | Python, AWS EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling, Multi-AZ, CloudWatch |
| **[url-shortener-aws](https://github.com/vibtellect/url-shortener-aws)** | A serverless URL shortener as a microservice with API Gateway and Lambda. Provides CRUD endpoints, stores short links in DynamoDB, and uses Infrastructure as Code for deployment. <br><br>üéØ **Learning:** Building and operating scalable serverless APIs with a focus on cost optimization, security, and IaC. | TypeScript, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, CDK, Serverless Design |
